Something useful that one finds in almost any Wikipedia article of a geographical feature is a reference locator map that accompanies the text (Ever wondered where [Timbuktu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbuktu) was?). The value of these static maps over the ubquituous Google type slippy maps that we see on the web today is that of context. Fixed scale reference maps like those on Wikipedia have been painfully handcrafted by a silent group of volunteer digital cartographers armed with an array of open source imaging libraries, GIS appications and hard drives of vector and raster data sources from organizations like NASA and the UN.
